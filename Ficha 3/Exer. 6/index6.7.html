            Let’s talk about cheap flights. We all know airlines are out to screw us over <br>
            — and no one wants to be the person who gets stuck paying the highest <br>
            fare. That’s why we spend hours upon hours researching articles on airfare, <br>
            trying to game the system like we’re attempting to outsmart a used car <br>
            salesman.

    <p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">
        <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/how-to-find-a-cheap-flight/" style="color: blue;">I’ve written about finding a cheap flight before</a> — and even 
        <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/booking-a-cheap-airfare-online/" style="color: blue;">my process <br>
            for booking a flight</a> — but today I want to talk about some persistent and <br>
            inaccurate myths about booking a flight that have stuck around through <br>
            simple inertia and lazy journalism.
